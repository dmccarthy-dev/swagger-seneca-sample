# swagger-seneca-sample
A sample API facade with Seneca microservices that showcase the Swagger-seneca-router module. Swagger-seneca-router is a Node.js connect/express middleware for routing REST API calls to Seneca micro-services. The idea is that you only have to work at the schema level in Swagger and the business logic level in Seneca. None of that dealing with boiler plate code!
